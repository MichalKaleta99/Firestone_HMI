# About
Visualization of the heating and cooling system made for Firestone.

# Graphical IDE

IDE that i used is named Citect Studio - its SCADA so besides graphical interphace I also was able to exchange data with logic controller (in that case - Allen-Bradley 5069-L306ERS2).

# Manual

Manual that I created is visible in one of files in my repo. Inside of that you can see screens of visualisation that I made.
